## SQL and Pandas Challenges

I have consistently built my analytical skills through hands-on, challenge-based practice focused on **problem-solving**.

- **SQL Advent Calendar by Interviewmaster**  
  Solved 24 daily SQL problems covering joins, subqueries, CTEs, aggregations, and analytical reasoning.

- **PrepVector – 15 Day SQL Challenge**  
  Worked through progressively challenging SQL problems to strengthen core querying concepts and structured thinking.

- **15-Day Python (Pandas) Challenge by Interviewmaster**  
  Practiced data cleaning, data wrangling, and transformation using pandas, focusing on handling messy datasets and preparing data for analysis.

These challenges strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced a structured, analytical approach to working with data.
