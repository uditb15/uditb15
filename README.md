## SQL and Pandas Challenges

I have strengthened my analytical skills through hands-on challenges focused on **problem-solving**.

- **SQL Advent Calendar by Interviewmaster**  
  Solved 24 daily SQL problems covering joins, subqueries, CTEs, aggregations, and analytical reasoning.

- **PrepVector – 15 Day SQL Challenge**  
  Worked through progressively challenging SQL problems to strengthen core querying concepts and structured thinking. Ranked 94 out of 1617 participants.

- **15-Day Python (Pandas) Challenge by Interviewmaster**  
  Solved complex data cleaning, data wrangling, and transformation problems using pandas focusing on handling messy datasets and preparing data for analysis.

These challenges strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced a structured, analytical approach to working with data.

## Featured Work

### TV Shows Analysis — Streamlit App

**Repo:** [TV Shows Analysis](https://github.com/uditb15/tv_shows_analysis)

**Application Link**: [Streamlit](https://uditb-tvshowsanalysis.streamlit.app/)

- Cleaned and analyzed 70k+ TV show records, built interactive Plotly visualizations, and deployed insights via a Streamlit app.”
- Performed extensive **data wrangling in pandas** to handle missing values, inconsistent categories, and formatting issues

- Built interactive **Plotly visualizations** to explore:
  - Genre Distributions
  - Rating Trends
  - Popularity Patterns

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analysis: from raw data → cleaned dataset → insights → interactive application.
